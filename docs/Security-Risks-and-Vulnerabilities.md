# Security Risks and Vulnerabilities

Homeowners may not realize the hidden vulnerabilities in DIY or basic security systems. As a Google ADT Security Systems Inspector and Solutions Architect, I help identify and address these risks, ensuring robust protection for you and your family.

## 1. Manual Key Vulnerabilities
Traditional locks with manual key entries are susceptible to a technique called **bump keying**, which allows criminals to unlock doors without visible damage.

- **Risk**: Unauthorized access without signs of forced entry.
- **Solution**: Google ADT’s digital lock systems eliminate the need for manual keys, reducing vulnerability to bump keys and enhancing security.

## 2. Online Scoping by Criminals
Criminals may use online real estate listings to identify homes without visible security, such as ADT signage, and locate camera blind spots.

- **Risk**: Criminals may identify vulnerable areas before even approaching.
- **Solution**: ADT signage and optimized camera placement can serve as a deterrent, and professional installation helps eliminate blind spots.

## 3. Vulnerability to Cable Cuts and Power Outages
DIY systems or those provided by cable companies often rely on internet or power connections, which can be disrupted.

- **Risk**: A cable cut or power outage can disable these systems, leaving the home unprotected.
- **Solution**: Google ADT systems come with **cellular backup** and **battery power**, keeping your security active even during outages.

## 4. Unencrypted Camera Feeds
Many DIY cameras lack encryption, meaning unauthorized individuals could access your video feeds.

- **Risk**: Privacy breaches and unauthorized access to your home’s surveillance.
- **Solution**: ADT cameras are fully encrypted, ensuring only you have access to your home’s footage, protecting your privacy.

## 5. Insurance Claim Challenges Without Forced Entry
Some insurance companies require visible signs of forced entry to approve claims. Techniques like bump keying and cable cuts often don’t leave damage.

- **Risk**: Denied insurance claims due to lack of evidence.
- **Solution**: ADT’s entry sensors and tamper detection provide a digital record of intrusion, supporting your insurance claims if needed.
